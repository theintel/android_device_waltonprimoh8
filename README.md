The recovery builds up without issues but doesnâ€™t work when flashed to the device. Probably the device tree is not properly configured.

## Getting Started ##
---------------

To get started with OMNI sources to build TWRP, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

# repo init

To initialize your local repository using the OMNIROM trees to build TWRP, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/minimal-manifest-twrp/platform_manifest_twrp_omni.git -b twrp-9.0

To initialize a shallow clone, which will save even more space, use a command like this:
# repo init

    repo init --depth=1 -u git://github.com/minimal-manifest-twrp/platform_manifest_twrp_omni.git -b twrp-9.0

# repo sync

If you are a first time builder then do check Imp_for_first_time_builders.txt file.
 Then to sync up:

    repo sync -j(nproc) -c

## To Build ##
---------------

Build the TWRP recovery using below command.

    cd <source-dir>; export ALLOW_MISSING_DEPENDENCIES=true; . build/envsetup.sh; lunch omni_YU5014-eng; mka recoveryimage
